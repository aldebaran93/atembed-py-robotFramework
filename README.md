# atembed-py-robotFramework
Testcases written with robotFramework and Python
In the directory Test_suite you will find other directories with particular names and inside are the .robot file or Python file
An object oriented approach will be used to implement all the test, therefore we will have a dedicated .robot where all regular functions will be store.
Another .robot file where all regular variabes can be found.
The Test case itself will mostly only call the functions and variable we described.
